## Description
The Unhoused Resources App aims to help the Unhoused community in the Seattle/King County area
to find either: 1) Food, 2) Shelter, 3) Medical services, 4) Hygiene services

The app uses the user's current location to find the closest locations based on their chosen resource (ex. Shelter)
It then shows a list of all available chosen resources - naturally ordered by distance - where pressing on a 
resource shows them summary information such as: Title, Google Reviews, time open, phone number, etc.

Clicking on the "directions" button allows them to go to the "map page" which uses Google maps to direct them
to their desired location
